Until now, we only focus on the study in the center of the torus.
Indeed, the program can only calculate the magnetic potential and field outside the torus,
therefore to be able to calculate *A* and *B* around the torus that implies to create a really complex geometry.
Instead of this, we use the Cartesian model which allow to calculate *A* and *B* inside the torus,
this allow us to calculate inside the torus, then we model a large sphere to represent the air all around the conductor.

With a simple torus, we can calculate the potential analytically like before.

Sadly, we can see that there is however some differences between the figures (on the scale)

The maximum of the error is approximately 0.8%, located on the torus.
