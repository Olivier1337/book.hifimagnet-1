== *Prepare your geometry*

First of all, you need to create the 3D model of your conductor with `Salome` or `gmsh` and to make the mesh.
When the mesh is created, with specific names for the volumes and surfaces, export it in `.med` (example : `example\_mesh.med`) with `Salome`.
You also need to partition the mesh if you want to do the calculations in parallel, running this command below.

example :
----
feelpp_mesh_partitioner --ifile example_mesh.med --part 4 --nochdir
----
Where `part` indicate the number of processors you want to use.
This will create a new file, call `example\_mesh\_p4.json` that you will use in your configure file.
