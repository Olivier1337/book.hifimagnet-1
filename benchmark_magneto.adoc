## Description of the example

In this example, we will compute the magnetic field generated by a stranded conductor.
The geometry of the conductor is choosen such that we can derive analytical expression
of the magnetic field.

## Geometry

The conductor $\Omega$ consists in a rectangular cross section torus.
The geometry also contains an external domain which is an approximation of $\mathbf{R}^3/\Omega$.

## Input parameters

current density: $\textbf{j}$ in $A/m^2$.

## Model & Toolbox

- The magnetostatic formulation in terms of magnetic potential $\textbf{A}$ may be found in xxx:
\[
\nabla^{2}\textbf{A}=-\mu\textbf{j}
\]
with $\textbf{A}$* the magnetic potential and $\textbf{j}$ the current density in $\Omega$.
The general solution of this equation is :
\[
A(\textbf{r})=-\mu\int_{\Omega}G(\textbf{r},\textbf{r'})\textbf{j}(\textbf{r'})
\]
with $G(\textbf{r},\textbf{r'})$ the Green's function defined as :
\[
G(\textbf{r},\textbf{r'})=\frac{1}{4\pi}\frac{1}{|\textbf{r}-\textbf{r'}|}
\]
with $\textbf{r}\in\mathbf{R}^3$ and $\textbf{r'}\in\Omega_{cond}$

Then it follows that the magnetic field $\textbf{B}$, defined as the curl of $\textbf{A}$, is:
\[
\textbf{B}(\textbf{r})=\frac{\mu_{0}}{4\pi}\int_{\Omega_{cond}}\frac{\textbf{j}(\textbf{r'})\times(\textbf{r}-\textbf{r'})}{|\textbf{r}-\textbf{r'}|^{3}} d\textbf{r'}\;\;\;\;\;\;\;\textbf{r}\in\Omega_{mgn}
\]
This is the so-called Biot \& Savart's law.

For simple conductor geometry, analytical expressions of the magnetic field may be found in physics textbooks.
As a classical result, we have the following expression for a "solenoidal" conductor with a constant current density
distribution for the magnetic field along the Z-Axis:
