== What is {hifimagnet}?


= Quick Starts

== Installation Quick Start


Using {hifimagnet} inside <<02-docker/what-is-docker.adoc#what-is-docker,Docker>> is the recommended and fastest way to use {hifimagnet}.
The <<02-docker/README.adoc#docker,Docker>> chapter is dedicated to Docker and using {feelpp} in Docker.

We strongly encourage you to follow these steps if you begin with {hifimagnet} in particular as an end-user.

People who would like to develop with and in {hifimanget} should read through the remaining sections of this chapter.

== Usage Start

Start the Docker container `feelpp/hifimagnet` as follows

[source,sh]
----
> docker run -it -v $HOME/feel:/feel feelpp/hifimagnet
----

NOTE: these steps are explained in the chapter on <<02-docker/hfimagnet-containers.adoc#hifimagnet-containers,{feelpp} containers>>.
