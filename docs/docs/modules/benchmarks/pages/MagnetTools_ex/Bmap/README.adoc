In this example, we will compute the "ideal" magnetic field produced by a test insert
described using {magnettools} format.

== Running the case

To run this example on MSO4SC portal see this xref:mso4sc:bmap.adoc[section].

=== Magnet Geometry

[TIP]
====

To get the geometry, you can use:

[source,sh]
----
B_map  --gnuplot HL-31.d > geom.dat
----

Edit `geom.dat` and keep only lines between:
```
PolyHelices data for HL-31.d ...
...
UnifMagnets data for HL-31.d ...
```

Plot the geometry with `gnuplot'
[source,sh]
----
gnuplot> set size ratio -1
gnuplot> set style data li
gnuplot> plot "HL-31-geom.dat" title "PolyHelices", "HL-31-Bitter-geom.dat" title "Bitters"
gnuplot> set xrange [0:0.7]
gnuplot> set yrange [-0.4:0.4]
----

====

=== Magnet Field

To compute the magnetic field:

[source,sh]
----
B_map --interactive HL-31.d
----

then enter the data for:

* Helix input current,
* Bitter input current,
* and eventually Supra outsert input current.

and set the ranges for the plot:

* stem:[r_0], stem:[r_1],
* stem:[z_0], stem:[z_1]

and the number of points in each direction

* stem:[n_r], stem:[n_z]

[IMPORTANT]
====
Watchout default unit is set to *meter* for the position range.
====

The result is stored in `HL-31_FieldMap.dat`.

[NOTE]
====
On first run, you will need to enter some more parameters before entering the currents and plot ranges data
if you don't have an `eps_params.dat` file in your directory.

On {mso4sc} Data Catalogue this file is already included in the dataset. 
====

For instance using the default current params, you get the following magnetic field stem:[B_z] profile along stem:[Oz] axis.

There are others usefull options to carry out calculation on list of points and so on...
See xref:magnetools:Bmap.adoc#bmap[here] for details.

== Data files

The data files may be retreived from {uri-msoportal-ckan-www}[*Data Catalogue*].
See the dataset *HL-31* in {lncmi} collection.

The gzipped archive tarball http://193.144.35.207/dataset/hl-31/resource/aef05e31-9712-48fb-8de1-56bb1098fd86[`HL-31-ana.tgz`] contains all the files needed.

=== Magnet Cfg file

* `HL-31.d`

== Outputs

The value of Magnetic Field in cylindrical coordinates at stem:[(r=0,z=0)] is: stem:[(0,37.8622880853634)]

To view the result with `gnuplot` in the remote desktop, type the following command:
