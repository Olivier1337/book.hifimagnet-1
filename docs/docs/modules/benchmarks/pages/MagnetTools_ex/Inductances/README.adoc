In this example, we will compute the "ideal" self and mutual inductances for a test insert
described using {magnettools} format.

== Running the case

To run this example on MSO4SC portal see this xref:mso4sc:inductance.adoc[section].

=== Magnet Geometry

image::HL-31/geom_axi.png[A 14 helices insert with 2 external bitter magnets]

[TIP]
====

To get the geometry, you can use:

[source,sh]
----
B_map  --gnuplot HL-31.d > geom.dat
----

Edit `geom.dat` and keep only lines between:
```
PolyHelices data for HL-31.d ...
...
UnifMagnets data for HL-31.d ...
```

Plot the geometry with `gnuplot`:

[source,sh]
----
gnuplot> set size ratio -1
gnuplot> set style data li
gnuplot> plot "HL-31-geom.dat" title "PolyHelices", "HL-31-Bitter-geom.dat" title "Bitters"
gnuplot> set xrange [0:0.7]
gnuplot> set yrange [-0.4:0.4]
----

====

=== Inductances

To compute the inductances:

[source,sh]
----
Inductances HL-31.d
----

then enter the data for:

* Helix input current,
* Bitter input current,
* and eventually Supra outsert input current.

[NOTE]
====
On first run, you will need to enter some more parameters before entering the currents and plot ranges data
if you don't have an `eps_params.dat` file in your directory.

On {mso4sc} Data Catalogue this file is already included in the dataset.

== Outputs

The inductance matrix is directly displayed in the main output:

[source,txt]
----
Computing Inductances [Henry]

		Helix			Bitter				
Helix		2.3195642547e-03	2.3391491498e-03	
Bitter		_			1.4224707838e-02

The code also computes the resistances:
