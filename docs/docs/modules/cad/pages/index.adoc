Welcome to {hifimagnet} Salome Plugin documentation!

NOTE: The {hifimagnet} Salome Plugin documentation describes its installation, its features, its uses  and
provides some references.

TIP: If you find errors or omissions in this document, please donâ€™t hesitate to
link:https://github.com/feelpp/hifimagnet/issues[submit an issue or open a pull
request] with a fix. We also encourage you to ask questions and discuss any
aspects of the project on the link:http://gitter.im/feelpp/hifimagnet[{hifimagnet}
Gitter forum]. New contributors are always welcome!

[[introduction]]
= Introduction

The {hifimagnet} Salome Plugin allows to easily:

* define CAD geometry for Solenoidal High Field Magnet
* mesh these geometries.

In a near future, the plugin will also provides tools:

* to define files required for running simulations,
* to run calculations either locally or remotely,
* to analyze the results

The meshing features require a license to http://www.meshgems.com/[{meshgems} suite].

[[quickstart]]
= Quick Starts

This document will illustrate how to simply use {hifimagnet} Salome plugin
and give examples for most common operations.

Custom installation, eg. for native installation, is detailed in appendix.

[[qs_installation]]
== Installation Quick Start

They are several way to use {hifimagnet} Salome plugin. The easiest way
is to use container, either Docker based or Singularity based. If your system support
singularity containers we recommend to use them instead of Docker ones.

You can download docker images from link:https://hub.docker.com/r/feelpp/salome/[feelpp/salome dockerhub].
Note that the images are private for the moment.

[TIP]
====
To use Salome in GUI mode the docker container should contain appropriate graphics drivers.
Actually only nvidia graphic cards are supported. To custom the images for you graphics
card you should have a look at the
link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/feelpp/hifimagnet/develop/docker/salome/build_salome.sh?token=ABP6f83LtdGN4ApDyGYlwkle_5jZeSy0ks5aeEu2wA%3D%3D[scripts] generating the images.

[[qs_reference]]
== Getting {hifimagnet} Salome plugin

=== sregistry
=== dockerhub
=== install from...

== Running {hifimagnet} Salome plugin

`-t` option may be used to switch to the TUI (eg. batch) mode.

=== from Singularity container

```
singularity exec [--nv] \
  -H $HOME:/home/$USER \
  -B $STORE/Distene/:/opt/DISTENE/DLim \
  feelpp_salome-mso4sc.simg \
  salome [-t] ...
```
Note the `--nv` flag is mandatory to run in GUI mode and is only supported by nvidia drivers.


=== from Docker container

```
xhost local:root
docker run -ti --rm -e DISPLAY -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
   -v $HOME/.Xauthority:/home/feelpp/.Xauthority --net=host --pid=host --ipc=host \
   --env QT_X11_NO_MITSHM=1 \
   -v $HOME/Salome_Packages:/home/feelpp/exports \
   feelpp/salome:8.3.0-nvidia
```

[TIP]
====
On Windows and MacOs X you would need a running X11 server.

[[installation]]
= Detailed Installation

This section describes {hifimagnet} {salome} Plugin installation from scratch. You can also use official {salome} binairies to build the plugin but this will not be detailed. 

Building {salome} from scratch is performed within a docker image to avoid any conflitcs with pre-existing configuration. The obtained binaries will exported at the end of the build process if successful as a compressed archive. The archive will be later used when creating the containers. 

All the scripts and docker or singularity recipes may be found in http://github.com/hifimagnet/[{hifimagnet} github repository].
In particular see the followings directory:

* docker: for all docker related stuff
* singularity: same for singularity
* package: for all debian/ubuntu packaging questions

[[usage]]
= Using {salome}

{salome} is an open-source generic platform for Pre- and Post-Processing for numerical simulation.
Its key features are:

* Supports interoperability between CAD modeling and computation software (CAD-CAE link).
* Provides access to all functionalities via the integrated Python console.

This latter feature is especially convenient. You can easily build a CAD model and save all
the performed operations within a python script. This script may be later run either in TUI (eg. batch) or GUI mode.
For instance, to create a cube and mesh it:
```
salome [-t] testcube_mesh.py
```
`-t` option is used to switch to the TUI (eg. batch) mode.  

[TIP]
====
The default mesh format generated by {salome} is med. This mesh format may not be supported
by {feelpp}. You can convert a med mesh into a gmsh mesh:
```
gmsh -3 -bin testcube.med -o testcube.msh
```
====

For detailed use of {salome}, see:

* http://salome-platform.org/user-section/documentation/current-release/current-release-gui[SALOME 8.4.0 Documentation]
* http://salome-platform.org/user-section/salome-tutorials/copy_of_salome-tutorial[Tutorial]

Examples:

* Test if {meshgems} is properly installed:
```
singularity exec \
  -H $HOME:/home/$USER \
  --pwd /home/$USER/Salome \
  -B $STORE/Distene/:/opt/DISTENE/DLim \
  feelpp_salome-mso4sc.simg \
  $SALOMEDIR/salome -t ghs3d_demo.py
```
where `SALOMEDIR=/opt/SALOME_8.3.0_MPI-DB9.3` is {salome} install directory.

* Create a simple med mesh and convert it to msh format in TUI mode:
```
SALOMEDIR=/opt/SALOME_8.3.0_MPI-DB9.3
singularity exec \
  -H $HOME:/home/$USER \
  --pwd /home/$USER/Salome \
  -B $STORE/Distene/:/opt/DISTENE/DLim \
  feelpp_salome-mso4sc.simg \
  $SALOMEDIR/salome -t testcube_mesh.py
singularity exec \
  -H $HOME:/home/$USER \
  --pwd /home/$USER/Salome \
  -B $STORE/Distene/:/opt/DISTENE/DLim \
   feelpp_salome-mso4sc.simg \
   gmsh -3 -bin testcube.med -o testcube.msh
```
