Welcome to {hifimagnet} Developper documentation!

[[install_salome]]
= {hifimagnet} {salome} plugin

This section describes {hifimagnet} {salome} Plugin installation from scratch. You can also use official {salome} binairies to build the plugin but this will not be detailed. 

Building {salome} from scratch is performed within a docker image to avoid any conflitcs with pre-existing configuration. The obtained binaries will exported at the end of the build process if successful as a compressed archive. The archive will be later used when creating the containers. 

All the scripts and docker or singularity recipes may be found in http://github.com/hifimagnet/[{hifimagnet} github repository].
In particular see the followings directory:

* docker: for all docker related stuff
* singularity: same for singularity
* package: for all debian/ubuntu packaging questions
