=== Becoming *DevUser*

Once registered in the portal, you  are a *EndUser*.
To be granted *DevUser* rights, just email to Portal Admins (actually Victor or Javi).

In he Canary Portal, A *DevUser* can only:

* <<registerapp, register>>/<<removeapp, remove>> apps
* <<sregistry_add_to_team, admin {sregistry}>> private collections


[[registerapp]]
===  Register an {hifimagnet} application

There is actually two routes to register an app:

* for all user
* using the *MarketPlace*

The recommended way is to use the <<marketplace, *MarketPlace*>>. However to speed up the tests,
the *DevUser* may register more easily his/her app for <<free_app, all users>>. Note that this
app will be available to every user of the platform.

[IMPORTANT]
====
An app can only be registered once. It means that once you have gone througth the registration process 
your only choice is to *RemoveApp*.

As a consequence, to upgrade your app package you have first to remove the app and go back to re-register your app.
====

[[free_app]]
==== For all users

To register an application for every user of the platform:

* Go to {uri-msoportal-experiment-dev-www}[*Experiments*],
* Select *Applications*
* Enter a new *Application Name*
* Choose a package file to load.

image::PortalMSO4SC_RegisterApp_Apps.png[Register App in MSOPortal]

[NOTE]
====
The package file is an gzipped archive holding the formal description of the app.
It's actually a directory which contains :

* a `blueprint.yml` TOSCA file that describes the workflow
* a `scripts` sub-directory holding the scripts required to deploy and undeploy the app

In this https://github.com/MSO4SC/resources/tree/canary/blueprint/feelpp/hifimagnet_test[git repository]
you will find the actual application corresponding to the {hifimagnet} basic demonstrator.

To actually build the app, use: ```./deploy pkg```
====

[TIP]
====
To debug an app, it may be convenient to use the Portal *orchestrator CLI*.
see https://github.com/MSO4SC/resources/blob/canary/blueprint/feelpp/hifimagnet_test/README.adoc[this file] for details
====

[[removeapp]]
==== Remove an app

* Go to {uri-msoportal-experiment-dev-www}[*Experiments*],
* Select *Applications*
* In the top sliding menu, select the app to be removed
* Click on *Remove*


[[sregistry_add_to_team]]

* finaly simply click on the red *save* button 

The previously selected user shall not be shown in the appropriate list according to your choice.

[[sregistry_add_to_collection]]
