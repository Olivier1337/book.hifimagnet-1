[[devuser]]
== *DevUser* role
:toc: macro
include::{partialsdir}/header-macro.adoc[]
include::{partialsdir}/header-uri.adoc[]
include::{partialsdir}/mso4sc-uri.adoc[]

=== Becoming *DevUser*

Once registered in the portal, you  are a *EndUser*.
To be granted *DevUser* rights, just email to Portal Admins (actually Victor or Javi).

[[registerapp]]
===  Register an {hifimagnet} application

To register an application you need to be *DevUSer*
The process is split into several part:

* add the app and create an offer in the {uri-msoportal-market-www}[*Marketplace*]:
** go to *My stock/Catalogue*
** go to *My stock/Product*
** go to *My stock/Offering*

Then you need to perform the following steps in *Experiments*:

* go to *RegisterApp*
** select your *Offering* in the sliding menu *New Products*
** give the app a meaningful name
** Choose a package file to load.

[NOTE]
====
The package file is an gzipped archive holding the formal description of the app.
It's actually a directory which contains :

* a `blueprint.yml` TOSCA file that describes the workflow
* a `scripts` sub-directory holding the scripts required to deploy and undeploy the app

In this https://github.com/MSO4SC/resources/tree/master/blueprint/feelpp/hifimagnet_test[git repository]
you will find the actual application corresponding to the {hifimagnet} basic demonstrator.

To actually build the app, use: ```./deploy pkg```
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
An app can only be registered once. It means that once you have gone througth the registration process 
your only choice is to *RemoveApp*.

As a consequence, to upgrade your app package you have first to remove the app and go back to re-register your app.
====

[[validorder]]
=== Validate an {hifimagnet} application purchase order

Once the app has been registered in the *Marketplace* (actually it means that an offering has been defined) you will be *owner* of this app. Any *EndUser* may purchase your app.
To check if you have any order:

* go to *My Inventory*
* go to *My Inventory/Product Orders*
* check *Recibibas* menu
* if any new message, you need to:
** click to validate the order
** click again to finalize the order

The *EndUser* may now proceed to perform *Experiments* with you product

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not forget to notify the user that he/she has to connect once to:

* {uri-sregistry-cesga}[{sregistry} service]
* {uri-msoportal-ckan-www}[*DataCatalogue*]

and eventually to :

* {uri-girder-unistras}[{girder} service]

This steps are mandatory for smooth operation of the app since the user has to be included
into {hifimagnet} user group. Fortunately this need to be done only once for any {hifimagnet} app.

Unfortunately the management of user has to be carried out manually by the *DevUser* in charge of the app
and cannot be performed from the portal.
====

[[sregistry_add_to_team]]
=== Adding an *EndUser* to {sregistry} team

For app like {hifimagnet} apps that require an private singularity image, you must grant *EndUser* access to the {sregistry} {hifimagnet} team.
To do so follow these instructions:

* Logged in to your {uri-sregistry-cesga},
* Click on *Teams* menu then select your *team*

image::sregistry_team.png[ex: {hifimagnet} {sregistry} team]

* As in the image above, click on *Invite Users*
* Copy the link (display in blue) and send it to your new *EndUser*

See https://singularityhub.github.io/sregistry/credentials[sregistry docs]

Once the *EndUser* will validate the invitation, his/her name will be display in the list
of members. You can also make him/her *owner* of the team by clicking on the *Make Owner* button.

To grant the *EndUser* access to the images in the {hifimagnet} collection, you need to proceed as follows:

* click on the *Collections* menu on the top left
* click on the link to the {hifimagnet} collections in the collections list
* once the list of images contained in the {hifimagnet} collection is display, you have to click *settings* button

A list of *owners* and *contributors* appears in the top right part of the page. Bellow are lists of user 
that are nor part of *owners* nor *contributors*. 

* To grant *owner* or *contributor* role to a given user select his/her name
* finaly simply click on the red *save* button 

The previously selected user shall not be shown in the appropriate list according to your choice.

[[sregistry_add_to_collection]]
=== Adding an new image into {sregistry} {hifimagnet} collection

To upload `salome-8.4.0.simg` newest image on {sregistry} {hifimagnet} collection
from your local machine you can type the following commands:

[source,sh]
----
export SREGISTRY_CLIENT=registry
export SREGISTRY_CLIENT_SECRETS=~/.sregistry
[export SREGISTRY_STORAGE=...]

sregistry push --name hifimagnet/salome --tag 8.4.0 salome-8.4.0.simg 
----

The `.sregistry` holds the {sregistry} *TOKEN* (to get the *TOKEN* see this <<section, using_sregistry>>).

[NOTE]
====
You need to install {https://singularityhub.github.io/sregistry-cli}[sregistry-cli] to get this working.

[[girder_add_to_team]]
