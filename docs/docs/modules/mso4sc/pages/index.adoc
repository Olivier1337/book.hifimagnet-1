TIP: do not check *gravatar* bug as it is buggy right now.

* Create an account there providing a valid email and a password.

Then you have to validate your account by following the instructions send
by the portal to your email address.

NOTE: Right now the portal *is not* using https protocol. As a consequence, the credentials `user/password` are
sent in clear. So be careful.

[NOTE]
====
In the sequel, each time you start a new service that relies on the IDM component responsible for the authentification
you will be notify by the system and will have to *authorize* this service like in the image below:

[[overview]]
== Overview of the Portal

image::PortalMSO4SC.png[Main page for MSOPortal]

the portal is split into several services:

* *Marketplace*, where you can add and/or purchase applications
* *Data Catalogue*, where you can add and/or retrieve data
* *Experiments*, where the app is setup and the simulation is launched
* *Visualization*, to access a Remote desktop to pre and/or post-processes your simulations

more details on:

* https://github.com/MSO4SC/MSOPortal/blob/master/portal/README.adoc[MSO4SC Front-end & Experiments Tool]
* https://business-api-ecosystem.readthedocs.io/en/v5.4.1/user-programmer-guide.html[*Marketplace* User manual]
* https://ckan.org/documentation-and-api/[*Data Catalogue* docs]

[NOTE]
====
For smooth operations of {uri-msoportal-www}[portal], the following ports have to *open*:

* `3000`: *IDM*, the service responsible for authentification 
* `5000`: *MarkePlace*
* `8000`: *Data Catalogue*

To check, you can use `nmap -p <port> portal.mso4sc.eu`.

You may need to contact your system admin to check and eventually open these ports.
