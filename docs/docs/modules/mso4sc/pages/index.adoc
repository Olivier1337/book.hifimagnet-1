This document will provide basic informations for *EndUsers* :

* to connect to the {uri-msoportal-www}[Portal],
* to purchase an {hifimagnet} application,
* to run an {hifimagnet} application.

An overview of the main portal functionalities is given in this <<overview,section>>.
This is followed by a brief description of the {hifimagnet} apps available and on the over-whole workflow
of actually running apps within the portal.

The user that have already an account on {uri-msoportal-www}[Portal] may skip the next section
and go directly to the section related to his/her role:

* xref::dev.adoc#devuser[*DevUser*]
* xref::user.adoc#enduser[*EndUser*]

NOTE: The main difference between *EndUser* and *DevUser* is that the latter can register an {hifimagnet} application.

TIP: do not check *gravatar* bug as it is buggy right now.

* Create an account there providing a valid email and a password.

Then you have to validate your account by following the instructions send
by the portal to your email address.

// NOTE: Right now the portal *is not* using https protocol. As a consequence, the credentials `user/password` are
// sent in clear. So be careful.

[NOTE]
====
In the sequel, each time you start a new service that relies on the IDM component responsible for the authentification
you will be notify by the system and will have to *authorize* this service like in the image below:

[[overview]]
== Overview of the Portal

image::PortalMSO4SC.png[Main page for MSOPortal]

the portal is split into several services:

* *Marketplace*, where you can add and/or purchase applications
* *Data Catalogue*, where you can add and/or retrieve data
* *Experiments*, where the app is setup and the simulation is launched
* *Visualization*, to access a Remote desktop to pre and/or post-processes your simulations
* *Q & A*, to access the Community tools for asking/answering specific questions
* *Docs*, to access the general documentation for MSO4SC project
* *Feedback*, to answer the questionnaire for MSO4SC project

more details on:

* https://github.com/MSO4SC/MSOPortal/blob/master/portal/README.adoc[MSO4SC Front-end & Experiments Tool]
* https://business-api-ecosystem.readthedocs.io/en/v5.4.1/user-programmer-guide.html[*Marketplace* User manual]
* https://ckan.org/documentation-and-api/[*Data Catalogue* docs]

[NOTE]
====
For smooth operations of {uri-msoportal-www}[portal], the following ports have to *open*:

* `3000`: *IDM*, the service responsible for authentification 
* `5000`: *MarkePlace*
* `8000`: *Data Catalogue*

To check, you can use `nmap -p <port> portal.mso4sc.eu`.

You may need to contact your system admin to check and eventually open these ports.


For *DevUser* using the {uri-msoportal-dev-www}[portal dev version] the ports to be opended are:.

== Synopsis of the {hifimagnet} Offering

The {hifimagnet} offering is created by *DevUser* as described in this xref::dev.adoc#registerapp[section].
Any *EndUser* may purchase the offering following the <<purchase, generic procedure>> or use an app available
for every user. Then, he or she can run the selected purchased offering or app provided that some fields are
properly filled as in this xref::user.adoc#running [example].


[NOTE]
====
For app that requires some additional services like:

* {sregistry}: a registry holding singularity images,
// * {girder}: a data management system

that requires additional settings (like credentials).

It is important to notify the *EndUser* that he has to get an account on these services.

For {sregistry} see this https://singularityhub.github.io/sregistry/credentials[manual]

For managing the account and this https://singularityhub.github.io/sregistry/client[note]
