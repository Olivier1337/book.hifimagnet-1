:toc: macro
include::{partialsdir}/header-macro.adoc[]
include::{partialsdir}/header-uri.adoc[]
include::{partialsdir}/mso4sc-uri.adoc[]


This document will provide basic information:

* to connect to the {uri-msoportal-www}[Portal],
* to register an {hifimagnet} application,
* to purchase an {hifimagnet} application,
* to run an  {hifimagnet} application.

and it defines the role of

* <<devuser, *DevUser*>>
* <<enduser, *EndUser*>>.

An overview of the main portal functionalities is given in this <<overview,section>>.
This is followed by a brief description of the {hifimagnet} apps available and on the over-whole workflow
of actually running apps within the portal.

The user that have already an account on {uri-msoportal-www}[Portal] may skip the next section
and go directly to the section related to his/her role.


[[connect]]
== Get an account on *MSO4SC Portal*

Connect to {uri-msoportal-www}[MSOPortal]

image::PortalMSO4SC_login.png[login page MSOPortal]

* Click on *login*

You will be forwarded to IDM component to the portal.

image::PortalMSO4SC_idm.png[IDM component of MSOPortal]

* *Sign up* to get an account

image::PortalMSO4SC_signup.png[IDM component of MSOPortal]

TIP: do not check *gravatar* bug as it is buggy right now.

* Create an account there providing a valid email and a password.

Then you have to validate your account by following the instructions send
by the portal to your email address.

NOTE: Right now the portal *is not* using https protocol. As a consequence, the credentials `user/password` are
sent in clear. So be careful.

[NOTE]
====
In the sequel, each time you start a new service that relies on the IDM component responsible for the authentification
you will be notify by the system and will have to *authorize* this service like in the image below:

image::add_service_IDM.png[Register new compnent to IDM MSOPortal]

====

[[overview]]
== Overview of the Portal

image::PortalMSO4SC.png[Main page for MSOPortal]

the portal is split into several services:

* *Marketplace*, where you can add and/or purchase applications
* *Data Catalogue*, where you can add and/or retrieve data
* *Experiments*, where the app is setup and the simulation is launched
* *Visualization*, to access a Remote desktop to pre and/or post-processes your simulations

more details on:

* https://github.com/MSO4SC/MSOPortal/blob/master/portal/README.adoc[MSO4SC Front-end & Experiments Tool]
* https://business-api-ecosystem.readthedocs.io/en/v5.4.1/user-programmer-guide.html[*Marketplace* User manual]
* https://ckan.org/documentation-and-api/[*Data Catalogue* docs]

[NOTE]
====
For smooth operations of {uri-msoportal-www}[portal], the following ports have to *open*:

* `3000`: *IDM*, the service responsible for authentification 
* `5000`: *MarkePlace*
* `8000`: *Data Catalogue*

To check, you can use `nmap -p <port> portal.mso4sc.eu`.

You may need to contact your system admin to check and eventually open these ports.

[[hifimagnet_offerings]]
== {hifimagnet} Offerings in *Marketplace*

Currently the apps available in the *Marketplace* are given in the table bellow.
They are grouped into 4 categories:

* MagnetTools:
* Preprocessing:
* Simulations:
* Postprocessing:
* Bundles:

.Available {hifimagnet} apps
[options="header,footer"]
|===
| Offering            | Description        | Category    | Notes
| {hifimagnet} Offering | Basic demonstrator | Simulations |
|===

For details about settings up these apps please refer to these <<offering_setup, docs>>.
For the new user we recommend to read this guide. The impatient may go directly to the <<enduser, *EndUser*>>
 and try to run the basic demonstrator.

== Synopsis of the {hifimagnet} Offering

The {hifimagnet} offering is created by *DevUser* as described in this <<registerapp, section>>.
Any *EndUser* may purchase the offering following the <<purchase, generic procedure>>. Then,
he or she can run the purchased offering provided that some fields are filled properly as in this <<running, example>>.
Details for setup each offering will be giving in the <<offering_setup, next section>>.

Even if each offering is specific, what is going on under the hood is described here:

* deploy:
* running:
* undeploy:

[NOTE]
====
For app that requires some additional services like:

* {sregistry}: a registry holding singularity images,
* {girder}: a data management system

that requires additional settings (like credentials).

It is important to notify the *EndUser* that he has to get an account on these services.

For {sregistry} see this https://singularityhub.github.io/sregistry/credentials[manual]

For managing the account and this https://singularityhub.github.io/sregistry/client[note]
to setup the {sregistry} client.

As for {girder} ...
====

[[devuser]]
== *DevUser* role

=== Becoming *DevUser*

Once registered in the portal, you  are a *EndUser*.
To be granted *DevUser* rights, just email to Portal Admins (actually Victor or Javi).

[[registerapp]]
===  Register an {hifimagnet} application

To register an application you need to be *DevUSer*
The process is split into several part:

* add the app and create an offer in the {uri-msoportal-market-www}[*Marketplace*]:
** go to *My stock/Catalogue*
** go to *My stock/Product*
** go to *My stock/Offering*

Then you need to perform the following steps in *Experiments*:

* go to *RegisterApp*
** select your *Offering* in the sliding menu *New Products*
** give the app a meaningful name
** Choose a package file to load.

[NOTE]
====
The package file is an gzipped archive holding the formal description of the app.
It's actually a directory which contains :

* a `blueprint.yml` TOSCA file that describes the workflow
* a `scripts` sub-directory holding the scripts required to deploy and undeploy the app

In this https://github.com/MSO4SC/resources/tree/master/blueprint/feelpp/hifimagnet_test[git repository]
you will find the actual application corresponding to the {hifimagnet} basic demonstrator.

To actually build the app, use: ```./deploy pkg```
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
An app can only be registered once. It means that once you have gone througth the registration process 
your only choice is to *RemoveApp*.

As a consequence, to upgrade your app package you have first to remove the app and go back to re-register your app.
====

[[validorder]]
=== Validate an {hifimagnet} application purchase order

Once the app has been registered in the *Marketplace* (actually it means that an offering has been defined) you will be *owner* of this app. Any *EndUser* may purchase your app.
To check if you have any order:

* go to *My Inventory*
* go to *My Inventory/Product Orders*
* check *Recibibas* menu
* if any new message, you need to:
** click to validate the order
** click again to finalize the order

The *EndUser* may now proceed to perform *Experiments* with you product

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not forget to notify the user that he/she has to connect once to:

* {uri-sregistry-cesga}[{sregistry} service]
* {uri-msoportal-ckan-www}[*DataCatalogue*]

and eventually to :

* {uri-girder-unistras}[{girder} service]

This steps are mandatory for smooth operation of the app since the user has to be included
into {hifimagnet} user group. Fortunately this need to be done only once for any {hifimagnet} app.

Unfortunately the management of user has to be carried out manually by the *DevUser* in charge of the app
and cannot be performed from the portal.
====

[[sregistry_add_to_team]]
=== Adding an *EndUser* to {sregistry} team

For app like {hifimagnet} apps that require an private singularity image, you must grant *EndUser* access to the {sregistry} {hifimagnet} team.
To do so follow these instructions:

* Logged in to your {uri-sregistry-cesga},
* Click on *Teams* menu then select your *team*

image::sregistry_team.png[ex: {hifimagnet} {sregistry} team]

* As in the image above, click on *Invite Users*
* Copy the link (display in blue) and send it to your new *EndUser*

See https://singularityhub.github.io/sregistry/credentials[sregistry docs]

Once the *EndUser* will validate the invitation, his/her name will be display in the list
of members. You can also make him/her *owner* of the team by clicking on the *Make Owner* button.

To grant the *EndUser* access to the images in the {hifimagnet} collection, you need to proceed as follows:

* click on the *Collections* menu on the top left
* click on the link to the {hifimagnet} collections in the collections list
* once the list of images contained in the {hifimagnet} collection is display, you have to click *settings* button

A list of *owners* and *contributorsllaborators* appears in the top right part of the page. Bellow are lists of user 
that are nor part of *owners* nor *contributors*. 

* To grant *owner* or *contributor* role to a given user select his/her name
* finaly simply click on the red *save* button 

The previously selected user shall  not be show in the appropriate list according to your choice.

[[sregistry_add_to_collection]]
=== Adding an new image into {sregistry} {hifimagnet} collection

To upload `salome-8.4.0.simg` newest image on {sregistry} {hifimagnet} collection
from your local machine you can type the following commands:

[source,sh]
----
export SREGISTRY_CLIENT=registry
export SREGISTRY_CLIENT_SECRETS=~/.sregistry
[export SREGISTRY_STORAGE=...]

sregistry push --name hifimagnet/salome --tag 8.4.0 salome-8.4.0.simg 
----

The `.sregistry` holds the {sregistry} *TOKEN* (to get the *TOKEN* see this <<section, using_sregistry>>).

[NOTE]
====
You need to install {https://singularityhub.github.io/sregistry-cli}[sregistry-cli] to get this working.
====

[[girder_add_to_team]]
=== Adding an *EndUser* to {girder}

[[ckan_dev]]
=== Data Catalogue

As a *DevUser* you can create *Organization* in {uri-msoportal-ckan-www}[*Data Catalogue*]

* click on *Organizations*
* click on *Add Organization*

You, then, need to fill the form and finalize the creation by clicking on the *create organization* button.

You have then to manage user that are allowed to be part of your organization.
They may the following role:

* *admin* : can view/add dataset, add user and manage role
* *editor* : can add dataset
* *member* : can view dataset

NOTE: *EndUser* has to connect at least once to *Data Catalogue* before you can grant them a role in your organization.

[[enduser]]
== *EndUser* role

TIP: when running into some strange portal behavior, first try to `logout/login` from the portal
before reporting an issue.

TIP: make sure that you have access to {uri-sregistry-cesga}[sregistry] holding all the singularity images.
Right now its the only such service (see key `sregistry_url` in blueprints) available in the frame of the project.

[[purchase]]
=== Purchase an application

To purchase an application from the *Marketplace* you can either be *DevUser*
or a simple *EndUser*. The process is the following:

* connect to the {uri-msoportal-ckan-www}[*Marketplace*], in *Home* (top left Marketplace page) you will find all available apps (*All categories*).
* Click on *Add to Cart* to purchase the app you want.
* Click on *Shopping Cart* and *Checkout* to go on
** fill the required forms for *shipping address*
** provide a *shipping address* if not already defined
** provide a *billing address* if not already defined
** Finalize your order by clicking on *Checkout*

To use the app, you will have to wait that the owner/seller of the app validate
you order. To check the status of your order:

* go to *My Inventory*
* go to *Product Orders*

You shall be to see your products and their status in each product form.

To finalize your purchase *DO NOT FORGET* to connect to :

* {uri-sregistry-cesga}[{sregistry}]
* {uri-msoportal-ckan-www}[*Data Catalogue*]
* {uri-girder-unistras}[{girder}]

Then notify the owner/seller that you request to be part of {hifimagnet} user group.
This will allow you to access {himagnet} singularity images and datasets.

NOTE: {girder} is optional.

[[data]]
=== Upload Data to *Data Catalogue*

* Connect to {uri-msoportal-ckan-www}[*Data Catalogue*]
* Select an organization
* Add a dataset if you are assign the role of *editor*

NOTE: you need to ask the owner/seller of {hifimagnet} app to be granted the role of *editor*

[[using_girder]]
=== Upload Data to {girder} service


[[hpc_setting]]
=== Setting up an HPC resource in *Experiments*

* Go to {uri-msoportal-experiment-www}[*Experiments*]
* Select *Settings*
* Define a HPC resource

[source,txt]
----
include::{examplesdir}/hpc.txt[]
----

[[using_sregistry]]
=== Connecting to {sregistry} service

Before proceeding to the setup of the app, you need to make sure, at least for {hifimagnet}
 app (or more generally for apps requiring access to a private singularity image) that you have
 been granted the proper right on {hifimagnet} {sregistry} team.

One more step consists in retrieving the *TOKEN* and storing it into your home directory on the HPC resource.
 This *TOKEN* is needed to download programmatically the {singularity} image :

* connect to {uri-sregistry-cesga}[{sregistry}] using {fiware} authentification
* go to your account (top right button)
* select *Token*

image::sregistry_token.png[ex: {Get {sregistry} token]
image::sregistry_apitoken.png[ex: {Display {sregistry} token]

* copy the token into a file `.sregistry`
* copy `.sregistry` on the HPC resource, see <<hpc_setting, previously defined>>, into your home directory

[NOTE]
====
To copy the file to the HPC resource you can use `scp .sregistry username@host:.`
or whatever method you prefer. `username` and `host` are key defined in the <<hpc_setting,HPC resource setting>>

You may connect to your account on HPC resource
```
ssh -Y username@host
```

If you cannot connect directly to the HPC resource, you may have to use alternative.
On cesga, you can either:

* connect to https://portalusuarios.cesga.es/auth[cesga user portal] with your credentials,
* click on *Create a new Desktop* to get a remote desktop
* in a *terminal* try to `scp user@yourmachine/.sregistry  $HOME`

an alternative consists in:

* a *VPN* solution: use cesga *fortisvpn client*

```
/opt/forticlient-sslvpn/64bit/forticlientsslvpn_cli --server gateway.cesga.es:443 --vpnuser user_email
```

====

[[running]]
=== Running an {hifimagnet} application in *Experiments*

* Select *Create App Instance*
** define an ID
** select a registered app in the menu

At this point you should have a page with all the options that need to be filled before moving to *Deploy Instance*

image::Portal_HifiMagApp.png[ex: Main {hifimagnet} app `3DSim`]

The fields to fill may be grouped into categories:

* specs for running simulations
* HPC settings
* specs retrieving singularity images
* specs for singularity image

The *EndUser* shall only need to fill the fields related to the 1st and 2nd category.
The fields that are to be filled by *EndUser* are marked in *bold*.

The others fields are designed for more advanced users.

====

Once filled, click on *Create Instance*.
This will result in the executions on the selected HPC resource of the bootstrap script included in the app definition.

TIP: Any error will result in a message at the top of the page, bellow the menus.

The next step is to *Deploy Instance*:

* select the *ID*, you defined in the previous step, in the *App instance * menu
* click on *Deploy*, wait until the button in blue turns green

To *Run Instance*, the procedure is similar:

* select the *ID*, you defined in the previous step, in the *App instance* menu
* click on *RUN*

[TIP]
====
These step may take some minutes to be performed. A red button will indicates an error.
Check the message in the frame bellow the status button. To have more details about the actual error
is more tricky; we recommend to:

* make sure you have unchecked the cleanup option
* connect to the HPC resource
* move to the selected `base_dir/working_prefix<id>`
* check the logs

`base_dir`, `working_prefix` are filled within the portal *Experiments*.
The `<id>` is a random character generated by the deployment.

An other option is to run the app using the *orchestrator CLI*.
see https://github.com/MSO4SC/resources/blob/master/blueprint/feelpp/hifimagnet_test/README.adoc[this file] for details

====

You may cleanup your working by

* UnDeploy your Instance
** select the *ID*, you defined in the previous step, in the *App instance * menu
** click on *UnDeploy*

* Destroy your Instance
** select the *ID*, you defined in the previous step, in the *App instance * menu
** click on *Destroy*

[[running_dataset]]
=== Running an {hifimagnet} application in *Experiments* using datasets from *DataCatalogue*

Basically the procedure is the same as <<running, above>>. The only difference here is that you need:

* to select a dataset in the *DataSet* sliding menu
* to validate your choice 
* to enter the name of the `<cfgfile> you will use

You should at the end have something like in the following image.

image::portal_running_dataset.png[Selecting a dataset]


[NOTE]
====
The dataset, at least those from {hifimagnet} organization in the *Data Catalogue* are
gzipped archive that holds all the files needed to run:

* a mesh or cad file
* a `<cfgfile>`
* a list of `json` files for physical properties and/or boundary conditions
* eventually some more files when using some {magnettools} features (eg ...)

The format of the files in a dataset are respectively described in:

* for {hifimagnet} simulation 
* for mesh and cad format
* for {magnettoools}

====

[[post]]
=== Setting up an Remote Desktop resource in *Visualization*

* Go to {uri-msoportal-visu-www}[*Visualization*]
* Select *Settings*
* Define a Remote Desktop resource

[source,txt]
----
include::{examplesdir}/remotedesktop.txt[]
----

=== Running an Remote Desktop resource in *Visualization*

* Go to *Visualization*
* Click *Desktop Available*
** Select your *Infrastructure* in the sliding menu

NOTE: if no *Remote desktop* is defined, you will receive a warning message. Create a <<post, *Setting*>>, then go back to this step.

** Click on *Create*
** Click either on *Desktop* or *View Only*

it should start a web page within your browser.
In this page you should be able to:

* start a 'terminal' and check the output of your simulation

The outputs of the job (ie `slurm` jobs) are stored in the `<hpc_basedir>/<hpc_workdir_prefix>_<date>_<id>`.
The actual results for the simulation would be stored in `<hpc_basedir>/feel` directory following {feelpp} usage.

[NOTE]
====
The result are stored in `${LUSTRE}/feel/...` if
you have chosen to use the `<hpc_volumes>` bindmount option: eg `${LUSTRE}/feel:/feel` on cesga.

Check the output of the script (aka `slurm-<id>.out`) in `<basedir>/<workdir_prefix>_<date>_<id>`
to see the exact name of this directory.

In `slurm-<id>.out` you should see lines like that at the beginning of the files:

[source,log]
----
Reading /usr/share/doc/hifimagnet/ThermoElectricModel/quarter-turn3D.cfg...
[ Starting Feel++ ] application thermoelectric version 0.1 date 2018-Jun-07

 .. logfiles :/feel/hifimagnet/ThermoElectricModel/quarter-turn3D.geo/thermoelectric-linear_V1T1_N1/np_2/logs
----

It means that the actual simulation results are store in `${LUSTRE}/feel/hifimagnet/ThermoElectricModel/quarter-turn3D.geo/thermoelectric-linear_V1T1_N1/np_2/exports/ensightgold/`
====

[NOTE]
====
The `<hpc_basedir>/<hpc_workdir_prefix>_<date>_<id>` directory remains present only if you have set `<do_not_delete_workdir>` to `true`.
The `<id>` field is a random number ...

This directory holds:

* `*.script`
* `slurm-*.out`
* `mso*.err`
* `mso*.out`

and the files coming from the dataset.
====

[TIP]
====
From a computer that is allowed to access HPC resources (if not use a *VPN* client):

* start a terminal,
* connect to the HPC resource with `ssh -Y <username>@<hpc_host>`,
* run `ls -lrt <hpc_basedir>` to find the actual name of the working directory which may appears as the last output of this command.
====

* start a post-processing GUI:
** either by loading {uri-paraview-www}[{paraview}]
** or using singularity {uri-ensight-www}[{ensight}] image
* to quit just click on `Menu/logout` (top left)

For more details on using {paraview} or {ensight} please check XXXX.

[NOTE]
====
In the remote desktop to get {paraview} running:

* open a terminal,
* type: `module load gcc/6.4.0 openmpi/2.1.1 paraview/5.4.0`
====

[NOTE]
====
For {ensight} you would need to have:

* a valid license stored in you account on the HPC resource 
* access to {ensight} singularity image from {hifimagnet} {sregistry} private collection.

In the remote desktop to get {ensight} running:

* open a terminal
* use the following script (see {ensight} doc in {hifimagnet} docs).
