TIP: when running into some strange portal behavior, first try to `logout/login` from the portal
before reporting an issue.

An *EndUser* can:

* <<purchase, purchase>> an application from the *MarketPlace*,
* <<data, manage>> datasets and Organizations in the *Data Catalogue*,
* <<running, run>> application in *Experiments*

[IMPORTANT]
====
Some apps are freely available for all portal users.
To use these apps, you can skip the purchase step.
Right now all {hifimagnet} apps are freely available.

Before going to the {uri-msoportal-experiment-www}[*Experiments*]
it is mandatory to connect at least to {uri-msoportal-market-www}[*Marketplace*] 
and to the {uri-msoportal-ckan-www}[*Data Catalogue*].

To use and create private datasets for storing inputs data and results,
you have to upload your *Data Catalogue key* into the Experiments *settings*
as described <<api_key, here>>.
====

[[purchase]]
=== Purchase an application

To purchase an application from the *Marketplace* you can either be *DevUser*
or a simple *EndUser*. The process is the following:

* connect to the {uri-msoportal-market-www}[*Marketplace*], in *Home* (top left Marketplace page) you will find all available apps (*All categories*).
* Click on *Add to Cart* to purchase the app you want.
* Click on *Shopping Cart* and *Checkout* to go on
** fill the required forms for *shipping address*
** provide a *shipping address* if not already defined
** provide a *billing address* if not already defined
** Finalize your order by clicking on *Checkout*

To use the app, you will have to wait that the owner/seller of the app validate
you order. To check the status of your order:

* go to *My Inventory*
* go to *Product Orders*

You shall see your products and their status in each product form.

To finalize your purchase *DO NOT FORGET* to connect to :

* {uri-sregistry-cesga}[{sregistry}]
* {uri-msoportal-ckan-www}[*Data Catalogue*]

Then notify the owner/seller that you request to be part of {hifimagnet} user group.
This will allow you to access {himagnet} singularity images and datasets.

[NOTE]
====
To access http://docs.cemosis.fr/hifimagnet/stable/[{hifimagnet} docs] you also need to have a user/password
====

// NOTE: The use of {uri-girder-unistras}[{girder} is optional.

[[data]]
=== Data Catalogue

Any user of the platform can create and manage *Organization* in the {uri-msoportal-ckan-www}[*Data Catalogue*]
to deal with private datasets.

==== Create and Manage *Organization*

* Connect to {uri-msoportal-ckan-www}[*Data Catalogue*]
* click on *Organizations*
* click on *Add Organization*

You, then, need to fill the form and finalize the creation by clicking on the *create organization* button.

You have then to manage user that are allowed to be part of your organization.
They may the following role:

* *Admin* : can view/add dataset, add user and manage role
* *Editor* : can add dataset
* *Member* : can view dataset

NOTE: User has to connect at least once to *Data Catalogue* before you can grant them a role in your organization.

[[api_key]]
==== Upload Data

* Connect to {uri-msoportal-ckan-www}[*Data Catalogue*]
* Add a dataset (requires *Editor* role for private organization)
** Make it public or private

To latter use private Organization and/or Dataset you would need to enter
*Data Catalogue key* in the *Settings* menu:

* To get the key:
** Connect to {uri-msoportal-ckan-www}[*Data Catalogue*]
** Click on *View Profile*

image::ckan_view_profile.png[*Data Catalogue* user profile]

** Scroll dow to view you *Data Catalogue key* on left side

image::ckan_apikey.png[Getting *Data Catalogue key*]

* Copy the key
* Connect to {uri-msoportal-experiment-www}[*Experiments*]
** Select "Settings"
** Paste or Enter your *Data Catalogue key*

image::setting_ckanapikey.png[Adding *Data Catalogue key* in *Settings*]

NOTE: To add a dataset to an existing organization, you may need to ask the *Admin* of the organization to be granted the role of *Editor* to do so. In our case it is the owner/seller of {hifimagnet} app.

// [[using_girder]]
// === Upload Data to {girder} service


[[hpc_setting]]
=== Setting up an HPC resource in *Experiments*

* Go to {uri-msoportal-experiment-www}[*Experiments*]
* Select *Settings*
* Define a HPC resource
* Upload eventually your *Data Catalogue key* (see <<api_key, here>>)

[source,txt]
----
include::{examplesdir}/hpc.txt[]

[[using_sregistry]]
=== Connecting to {sregistry} service

Before proceeding to the setup of the app, you need to make sure, at least for {hifimagnet}
 app (or more generally for apps requiring access to a private singularity image) that you have
 been granted the proper right on {hifimagnet} {sregistry} team.

One more step consists in retrieving the *TOKEN* and storing it into your home directory on the HPC resource.
 This *TOKEN* is needed to download programmatically the {singularity} image :

* connect to {uri-sregistry-cesga}[{sregistry}] using {fiware} authentification
* go to your account (top right button)
* select *Token*

image::sregistry_token.png[ex: {Get {sregistry} token]
image::sregistry_apitoken.png[ex: {Display {sregistry} token]

* copy the token into a file `.sregistry`
* copy `.sregistry` on the HPC resource, see <<hpc_setting, previously defined>>, into your home directory

[[note_sregistry_secret]]
[NOTE]
====
To copy the file to the HPC resource you can use `scp .sregistry username@hpc_host:.`
or whatever method you prefer. `username` and `hpc_host` are key defined in the <<hpc_setting,HPC resource setting>>.

You may connect to your account on HPC resource
```
ssh -Y username@hpc_host
```

If you cannot connect directly to the HPC resource, you may have to use alternative.
On cesga, you can either:

* connect to https://portalusuarios.cesga.es/auth[cesga user portal] with your credentials,
* click on *Create a new Desktop* to get a remote desktop
* in a *terminal* try to `scp user@yourmachine/.sregistry  $HOME`

an alternative consists in:

* a *VPN* solution: use cesga *fortisvpn client*

```
/opt/forticlient-sslvpn/64bit/forticlientsslvpn_cli --server gateway.cesga.es:443 --vpnuser user_email
```
====

[[using_licenses]]
=== Uploading license keys

If you wish to perform pre and processing, you may need to upload license keys on the hpc ressource
you plan to use.

To do so you may proceed for each license key as in the <<note_sregistry_secret, note>> above for {sregistry} secret.


[[running]]
=== Running an {hifimagnet} application in *Experiments*

image::PortalMSO4SC_Exp_User.png[*Experiments* *Instances* main menu for *EndUSer*]

* Go to {uri-msoportal-experiment-www}[*Experiments*]
* Select *Instances*
** define an ID
** select a registered app in the sliding menu

At this point you should have a page with all the options that need to be filled.

image::portal_magtherm_inputs.png[ex: {hifimagnet} app `MagTherm`]

The fields to fill may be grouped into categories:

* specs for running simulations
* HPC settings
* specs retrieving singularity images
* specs for singularity image

The *EndUser* shall only need to fill the fields related to the 1st and 2nd category.
The fields that are to be filled by *EndUser* are marked in *bold*.

The others fields are designed for more advanced users.

Once filled, click on *Create New Instance*.

TIP: While creating a new app instance, any error will result in a popup message.

image::portal_magtherm_running.png[ex: Running {hifimagnet} `MagTherm`]

The next step is to to launch the app:

* select the *ID*, you defined in the previous step,
* click on *Run*, wait until the button in blue turns green


[TIP]
====
A red button will indicates an error.
Check the message in the frame bellow the status button.
To have more details about the actual error is more tricky; we recommend to:

* make sure you have unchecked the cleanup option
* connect to the HPC resource using for instance the <<RemoteDesktop, *Remote Desktop*>>
* move to the selected `<hpc_basedir>/<hpc_working_prefix>_<date>_<id>`
* check the logs

`<hpc_basedir>` is given as inputs of the experiment (see above). 
`<hpc_working_prefix>` is set by default by the app (eg: `hifimagnet` for `M̀agTherm` app).
The `<id>` is a random character generated when creating the instance.
====

Finaly to destroy your instance, just click on:

* *Destroy Instance!*
* or *Force Destroy*

This will remove your *ID* from the instance list.


[[running_dataset]]
=== Running an {hifimagnet} application in *Experiments* using datasets from *DataCatalogue*

Basically the procedure is the same as <<running, above>>. The only difference here is that you need:

* to select a dataset in the *DataSet* sliding menu
* to select a ressource within the *DataSet* 
* to enter the name of the `<cfgfile> you will use

You should at the end have something like in the following image.

image::portal_running_dataset.png[Selecting a dataset]


[NOTE]
====
The dataset, at least those from {hifimagnet} organization in the *Data Catalogue* are
gzipped archive that holds all the files needed to run:

* a mesh or cad file
* a `<cfgfile>`
* a list of `json` files for physical properties and/or boundary conditions
* eventually some more files when using some {magnettools} features (eg ...)

The format of the files in a dataset are respectively described in:

* for {hifimagnet} simulation 
* for mesh and cad format
* for {magnettools}

=== Setting up an Remote Desktop resource in *Visualization*

* Go to {uri-msoportal-visu-www}[*Visualization*]
* Select *Settings*
* Define a Remote Desktop resource

[[RemoteDesktop]]
=== Running an Remote Desktop resource in *Visualization*

* Go to *Visualization*
* Click *Desktop Available*
** Select your *Infrastructure* in the sliding menu

NOTE: if no *Remote desktop* is defined, you will receive a warning message. Create a <<post, *Setting*>>, then go back to this step.

** Click on *Create*
** Click either on *Desktop* or *View Only*

it should start a web page within your browser.
In this page you should be able to:

* start a 'terminal' and check the output of your simulation

The outputs of the job (ie `slurm` jobs) are stored in the `<hpc_basedir>/<hpc_workdir_prefix>_<date>_<id>`.
The actual results for the simulation would be stored in `<hpc_basedir>/feel` directory following {feelpp} usage.

[NOTE]
====
The result are stored in `${LUSTRE}/feel/...` if
you have chosen to use the `<hpc_volumes>` bindmount option: eg `${LUSTRE}/feel:/feel` on cesga.

Check the output of the script (aka `slurm-<id>.out`) in `<basedir>/<workdir_prefix>_<date>_<id>`
to see the exact name of this directory.

In `slurm-<id>.out` you should see lines like that at the beginning of the files:

[source,log]
----
Reading /usr/share/doc/hifimagnet/ThermoElectricModel/quarter-turn3D.cfg...

It means that the actual simulation results are store in `${LUSTRE}/feel/hifimagnet/ThermoElectricModel/quarter-turn3D.geo/thermoelectric-linear_V1T1_N1/np_2/exports/ensightgold/`
====

[NOTE]
====
The `<hpc_basedir>/<hpc_workdir_prefix>_<date>_<id>` directory remains present only if you have set `<do_not_delete_workdir>` to `true`.
The `<id>` field is a random number ...

This directory holds:

* `*.script`
* `slurm-*.out`
* `mso*.err`
* `mso*.out`

and the files coming from the dataset.
====


* start a post-processing GUI:
** either by loading {uri-paraview-www}[{paraview}]
** or using singularity {uri-ensight-www}[{ensight}] image
* to quit just click on `Menu/logout` (top left)

For more details on using {paraview} or {ensight} please check this xref:post:index.adoc#post_manual[section].

[NOTE]
====
In the remote desktop to get {paraview} running:

* open a terminal,
* type: `module load gcc/6.4.0 openmpi/2.1.1 paraview/5.4.0`
====

[NOTE]
====
For {ensight} you would need to have:

* a valid license stored in you account on the HPC resource 
* access to {ensight} singularity image from {hifimagnet} {sregistry} private collection.

In the remote desktop to get {ensight} running:

* open a terminal
* use the following script (see [xref:post:index.adoc#ensight{ensight} docs]).
