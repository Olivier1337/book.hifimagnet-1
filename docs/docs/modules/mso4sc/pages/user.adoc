[[enduser]]
== *EndUser* role

TIP: when running into some strange portal behavior, first try to `logout/login` from the portal
before reporting an issue.

TIP: make sure that you have access to {uri-sregistry-cesga}[sregistry] holding all the singularity images.
Right now its the only such service (see key `sregistry_url` in blueprints) available in the frame of the project.

[[purchase]]
=== Purchase an application

To purchase an application from the *Marketplace* you can either be *DevUser*
or a simple *EndUser*. The process is the following:

* connect to the {uri-msoportal-ckan-www}[*Marketplace*], in *Home* (top left Marketplace page) you will find all available apps (*All categories*).
* Click on *Add to Cart* to purchase the app you want.
* Click on *Shopping Cart* and *Checkout* to go on
** fill the required forms for *shipping address*
** provide a *shipping address* if not already defined
** provide a *billing address* if not already defined
** Finalize your order by clicking on *Checkout*

To use the app, you will have to wait that the owner/seller of the app validate
you order. To check the status of your order:

* go to *My Inventory*
* go to *Product Orders*

You shall be to see your products and their status in each product form.

To finalize your purchase *DO NOT FORGET* to connect to :

* {uri-sregistry-cesga}[{sregistry}]
* {uri-msoportal-ckan-www}[*Data Catalogue*]
* {uri-girder-unistras}[{girder}]

Then notify the owner/seller that you request to be part of {hifimagnet} user group.
This will allow you to access {himagnet} singularity images and datasets.

NOTE: {girder} is optional.

[[data]]
=== Upload Data to *Data Catalogue*

* Connect to {uri-msoportal-ckan-www}[*Data Catalogue*]
* Select an organization
* Add a dataset if you are assign the role of *editor*

NOTE: you need to ask the owner/seller of {hifimagnet} app to be granted the role of *editor*

[[using_girder]]
=== Upload Data to {girder} service


[[hpc_setting]]
=== Setting up an HPC resource in *Experiments*

* Go to {uri-msoportal-experiment-www}[*Experiments*]
* Select *Settings*
* Define a HPC resource

[source,txt]
----
include::{examplesdir}/hpc.txt[]
----

[[using_sregistry]]
=== Connecting to {sregistry} service

Before proceeding to the setup of the app, you need to make sure, at least for {hifimagnet}
 app (or more generally for apps requiring access to a private singularity image) that you have
 been granted the proper right on {hifimagnet} {sregistry} team.

One more step consists in retrieving the *TOKEN* and storing it into your home directory on the HPC resource.
 This *TOKEN* is needed to download programmatically the {singularity} image :

* connect to {uri-sregistry-cesga}[{sregistry}] using {fiware} authentification
* go to your account (top right button)
* select *Token*

image::sregistry_token.png[ex: {Get {sregistry} token]
image::sregistry_apitoken.png[ex: {Display {sregistry} token]

* copy the token into a file `.sregistry`
* copy `.sregistry` on the HPC resource, see <<hpc_setting, previously defined>>, into your home directory

[NOTE]
====
To copy the file to the HPC resource you can use `scp .sregistry username@host:.`
or whatever method you prefer. `username` and `host` are key defined in the <<hpc_setting,HPC resource setting>>

You may connect to your account on HPC resource
```
ssh -Y username@host
```

If you cannot connect directly to the HPC resource, you may have to use alternative.
On cesga, you can either:

* connect to https://portalusuarios.cesga.es/auth[cesga user portal] with your credentials,
* click on *Create a new Desktop* to get a remote desktop
* in a *terminal* try to `scp user@yourmachine/.sregistry  $HOME`

an alternative consists in:

* a *VPN* solution: use cesga *fortisvpn client*

```
/opt/forticlient-sslvpn/64bit/forticlientsslvpn_cli --server gateway.cesga.es:443 --vpnuser user_email
```

====

[[running]]
=== Running an {hifimagnet} application in *Experiments*

* Select *Create App Instance*
** define an ID
** select a registered app in the menu

At this point you should have a page with all the options that need to be filled before moving to *Deploy Instance*

image::Portal_HifiMagApp.png[ex: Main {hifimagnet} app `3DSim`]

The fields to fill may be grouped into categories:

* specs for running simulations
* HPC settings
* specs retrieving singularity images
* specs for singularity image

The *EndUser* shall only need to fill the fields related to the 1st and 2nd category.
The fields that are to be filled by *EndUser* are marked in *bold*.

The others fields are designed for more advanced users.

[IMPORTANT]
====
HPC settings for local {lncmi} ressources are specificied xref::lncmi-hpc.adoc[here]
====

Once filled, click on *Create Instance*.
This will result in the executions on the selected HPC resource of the bootstrap script included in the app definition.

TIP: Any error will result in a message at the top of the page, bellow the menus.

The next step is to *Deploy Instance*:

* select the *ID*, you defined in the previous step, in the *App instance * menu
* click on *Deploy*, wait until the button in blue turns green

To *Run Instance*, the procedure is similar:

* select the *ID*, you defined in the previous step, in the *App instance* menu
* click on *RUN*

[TIP]
====
These step may take some minutes to be performed. A red button will indicates an error.
Check the message in the frame bellow the status button. To have more details about the actual error
is more tricky; we recommend to:

* make sure you have unchecked the cleanup option
* connect to the HPC resource
* move to the selected `base_dir/working_prefix<id>`
* check the logs

`base_dir`, `working_prefix` are filled within the portal *Experiments*.
The `<id>` is a random character generated by the deployment.

An other option is to run the app using the *orchestrator CLI*.
see https://github.com/MSO4SC/resources/blob/master/blueprint/feelpp/hifimagnet_test/README.adoc[this file] for details

====

You may cleanup your working by

* UnDeploy your Instance
** select the *ID*, you defined in the previous step, in the *App instance * menu
** click on *UnDeploy*

* Destroy your Instance
** select the *ID*, you defined in the previous step, in the *App instance * menu
** click on *Destroy*

[[running_dataset]]
=== Running an {hifimagnet} application in *Experiments* using datasets from *DataCatalogue*

Basically the procedure is the same as <<running, above>>. The only difference here is that you need:

* to select a dataset in the *DataSet* sliding menu
* to validate your choice 
* to enter the name of the `<cfgfile> you will use

You should at the end have something like in the following image.

image::portal_running_dataset.png: {Selecting a dataset}


[NOTE]
====
The dataset, at least those from {hifimagnet} organization in the *Data Catalogue* are
gzipped archive that holds all the files needed to run:

* a mesh or cad file
* a `<cfgfile>`
* a list of `json` files for physical properties and/or boundary conditions
* eventually some more files when using some {magnettools} features (eg ...)

The format of the files in a dataset are respectively described in:

* for {hifimagnet} simulation 
* for mesh and cad format
* for {magnettoools}

====

[[post]]
=== Setting up an Remote Desktop resource in *Visualization*

* Go to {uri-msoportal-visu-www}[*Visualization*]
* Select *Settings*
* Define a Remote Desktop resource

[source,txt]
----
include::{examplesdir}/remotedesktop.txt[]
----

=== Running an Remote Desktop resource in *Visualization*

* Go to *Visualization*
* Click *Desktop Available*
** Select your *Infrastructure* in the sliding menu

NOTE: if no *Remote desktop* is defined, you will receive a warning message. Create a <<post, *Setting*>>, then go back to this step.

** Click on *Create*
** Click either on *Desktop* or *View Only*

it should start a web page within your browser.
In this page you should be able to:

* start a 'terminal' and check the output of your simulation

The outputs of the job (ie `slurm` jobs) are stored in the `<hpc_basedir>/<hpc_workdir_prefix>_<date>_<id>`.
The actual results for the simulation would be stored in `<hpc_basedir>/feel` directory following {feelpp} usage.

[NOTE]
====
The result are stored in `${LUSTRE}/feel/...` if
you have chosen to use the `<hpc_volumes>` bindmount option: eg `${LUSTRE}/feel:/feel` on cesga.

Check the output of the script (aka `slurm-<id>.out`) in `<basedir>/<workdir_prefix>_<date>_<id>`
to see the exact name of this directory.

In `slurm-<id>.out` you should see lines like that at the beginning of the files:

[source,log]
----
Reading /usr/share/doc/hifimagnet/ThermoElectricModel/quarter-turn3D.cfg...
[ Starting Feel++ ] application thermoelectric version 0.1 date 2018-Jun-07
 . thermoelectric files are stored in /feel/thermoelectric/np_2
 .. exports :/feel/thermoelectric/np_2/exports

 .. logfiles :/feel/hifimagnet/ThermoElectricModel/quarter-turn3D.geo/thermoelectric-linear_V1T1_N1/np_2/logs
----

It means that the actual simulation results are store in `${LUSTRE}/feel/hifimagnet/ThermoElectricModel/quarter-turn3D.geo/thermoelectric-linear_V1T1_N1/np_2/exports/ensightgold/`
====

[NOTE]
====
The `<hpc_basedir>/<hpc_workdir_prefix>_<date>_<id>` directory remains present only if you have set `<do_not_delete_workdir>` to `true`.
The `<id>` field is a random number ...

This directory holds:

* `*.script`
* `slurm-*.out`
* `mso*.err`
* `mso*.out`

and the files coming from the dataset.
====

[TIP]
====
From a computer that is allowed to access HPC resources (if not use a *VPN* client):

* start a terminal,
* connect to the HPC resource with `ssh -Y <username>@<hpc_host>`,
* run `ls -lrt <hpc_basedir>` to find the actual name of the working directory which may appears as the last output of this command.
====

* start a post-processing GUI:
** either by loading {uri-paraview-www}[{paraview}]
** or using singularity {uri-ensight-www}[{ensight}] image
* to quit just click on `Menu/logout` (top left)

For more details on using {paraview} or {ensight} please check XXXX.

[NOTE]
====
In the remote desktop to get {paraview} running:

* open a terminal,
* type: `module load gcc/6.4.0 openmpi/2.1.1 paraview/5.4.0`
====

[NOTE]
====
For {ensight} you would need to have:

* a valid license stored in you account on the HPC resource 
* access to {ensight} singularity image from {hifimagnet} {sregistry} private collection.

In the remote desktop to get {ensight} running:

* open a terminal
* use the following script (see {ensight} doc in {hifimagnet} docs).
