[[quickstart]]
= Quick Starts


[[qs_installation]]
== Installation Quick Start


Using {hifimagnet} inside https://www.docker.com/what-docker[Docker] is the recommended and fastest way to use {hifimagnet}.
The xref:user:ROOT:install/containers.adoc#Docker[Docker chapter] is dedicated to Docker and using {feelpp} in Docker.

We strongly encourage you to follow these steps if you begin with {hifimagnet} in particular as an end-user.

People who would like to develop with and in {hifimagnet} should read through the remaining sections of this chapter.

[[qs_usage]]
== Usage Start

Start the Docker container `feelpp/hifimagnet` as follows

[source,sh]
----
docker run -it -v $HOME/feel:/feel feelpp/hifimagnet
----

NOTE: these steps are explained in the chapter on xref:index.adoc#installation_container[{hifimagnet}] and
xref:user:ROOT:install/containers.adoc#Docker[{feelpp} containers].

[[usage_magnettools]]
== Using {magnettools}

{magnettools} is a in-house software that provides tools to compute :

 * Analytically Magnetic Field,
 * Mutual and Self Inductances,
 * Axial and Radial Forces,

and to analyze some Transient Analysis.

{magnettools} also contains:

  * Optimization procedure to define the PolyHelices insert geometry,
  * Files for CAD and CAM of Helices.
